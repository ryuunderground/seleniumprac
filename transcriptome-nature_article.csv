Hippocampal transcriptome-wide association study and pathway analysis of mitochondrial solute carriers in Alzheimer’s disease,"['784 Accesses', '7 Altmetric']","The etiopathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as the result of the combination of the aging process, toxic proteins, brain dysmetabolism, and genetic risks. Although the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD has been well-appreciated, the interaction between mitochondrial function and genetic variability in promoting dementia is still poorly understood. In this study, by tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and further meta-analysis, we examined the genetic association between mitochondrial solute carrier family (SLC25) genes and AD in three independent cohorts and identified three AD-susceptibility genes, including SLC25A10, SLC25A17, and SLC25A22. Integrative analysis using neuroimaging data and hippocampal TWAS-predicted gene expression of the three susceptibility genes showed an inverse correlation of SLC25A22 with hippocampal atrophy rate in AD patients, which outweighed the impacts of sex, age, and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4). Furthermore, SLC25A22 downregulation demonstrated an association with AD onset, as compared with the other two transcriptome-wide significant genes. Pathway and network analysis related hippocampal SLC25A22 downregulation to defects in neuronal function and development, echoing the enrichment of SLC25A22 expression in human glutamatergic neurons. The most parsimonious interpretation of the results is that we have identified AD-susceptibility genes in the SLC25 family through the prediction of hippocampal gene expression. Moreover, our findings mechanistically yield insight into the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis of AD and pave the way for the future development of diagnostic tools for the early prevention of AD from a perspective of precision medicine by targeting the mitochondria-related genes."
De novo genome assembly and transcriptome sequencing in foot and mantle tissues of Megaustenia siamensis reveals components of adhesive substances,"['333 Accesses', '1 Altmetric']","The semislug Megaustenia siamensis, commonly found in Thailand, is notable for its exceptional capacity to produce biological adhesives, enabling it to adhere to tree leaves even during heavy rainfall. In this study, we generated the first reference genome for M. siamensis using a combination of three sequencing technologies: Illumina’s short-read, Pac-Bio’s HIFI long-read, and Hi-C. The assembled genome size was 2593 billion base pairs (bp), containing 34,882 protein-coding genes. Our analysis revealed positive selection in pathways associated with the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Furthermore, RNA sequencing of foot and mantle tissues unveiled the primary constituents of the adhesive, including lectin-like proteins (C-lectin, H-lectin, and C1q) and matrilin-like proteins (VWA and EGF). Additionally, antimicrobial peptides were identified. The comprehensive M. siamensis genome and tissue-specific transcriptomic data provided here offer valuable resources for understanding its biology and exploring potential medical applications."
Combined transcriptome and genome analysis of single micrometastatic cells,"['2862 Accesses', '240 Citations', '11 Altmetric']","In human cancer, early systemic spread of tumor cells is recognized as a leading cause of death. Adjuvant therapies are administered to patients after complete resectioning of their primary tumors to eradicate the few residual and latent metastatic cells. These therapeutic regimens, however, are currently designed without direct information about the presence or nature of the latent cells. To address this problem, we developed a PCR-based technique to analyze the transcriptome of individual tumor cells isolated from the bone marrow of cancer patients. From the same cells, genomic aberrations were identified by comparative genomic hybridization. The utility of this approach for understanding the biology of occult disseminated cells and for the identification of new therapeutic targets is demonstrated here by the detection of frequent extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN; CD147) expression which was verified by immunostaining."
Coincidence between transcriptome analyses on different microarray platforms using a parametric framework,['119 Accesses'],"A parametric framework for the analysis of transcriptome data is demonstrated to yield coincident results when applied to data acquired using two different microarray platforms. Discrepancies among transcriptome studies are frequently reported, casting doubt on the reliability of collected data. The inconsistency among observations can be largely attributed to differences among the analytical frameworks employed for data analysis. The existing frameworks normalizes data against a standard determined from the data to be analyzed. In the present study, a parametric framework based on a strict model for normalization is applied to data acquired using an in-house printed chip and GeneChip. The framework is based on a common statistical characteristic of microarray data, and each data is normalized on the basis of a linear relationship with this model. In the proposed framework, the expressional changes observed and genes selected are coincident between platforms, achieving superior universality of data compared to other methods."
RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling of early fruit development in Chieh-qua and analysis of related transcription factors,['241 Accesses'],"Chieh-qua (Benincasa hispida Cogn. var. Chieh-qua How.) fruit development starts post pollination. With the continuous expansion of the fruit, the soluble solid content of the fruit decreases. Because there are no reports on the early development of Chieh-qua fruit, this study compared fruit transcriptomes at 0-, 3-, and 7 day post pollination (dpp). 104,747 unigenes were assembled from clean reads and compared using six public databases for similarity searching. Compared with those of 0 dpp (C), there were differences in the expression of 12,982 and 6541 genes in the fruit tissue at 3 dpp and 7 dpp, respectively. Compared with 3 dpp (B), there were 14,314 differentially expressed genes in the fruit at 7 dpp (A). Based on the analysis of transcription factors, 213 nucleotides in the MYB superfamily were identified; among them, 94 unigenes of the MYB superfamily were differentially expressed at the three stages. In the pairwise comparison of differential expression, eight unigenes (Gene_id: TRINITY_DN32880_c1_g2, TRINITY_DN35142_c2_g2, TRINITY_DN32454_c11_g6, TRINITY_DN34105_c2_g7, TRINITY_DN32758_c3_g3, TRINITY_DN33604_c4_g10, TRINITY_DN34466_c3_g1, TRINITY_DN35924_c3_g2) were homologous to those of MYB59, MYB-GT3b, MYB18, MYB4, MYB108, MYB306, MYB340, and MYB-bHLH13. These unigenes differed significantly among the three stages. Furthermore, MYB59 and MYB18 exhibited higher expression at 7 dpp. MYB4, MYB-GT3b, MYB108, and MYB306 showed the highest expression levels in fruits at 3 dpp. In addition, MYB340 and MYB-bHLH13 showed higher expression levels during the unpollinated stage. MYB59, MYB-GT3b, MYB18, MYB4, MYB108, MYB306, MYB340, and MYB-bHLH13 may play crucial roles in Chieh-qua fruit development, defense, and blossoming. This study provides a basis for further investigation of MYB superfamily genes involved in early fruit expansion in chieh-qua."
Transcriptome analysis reveals genes associated with late blight resistance in potato,['264 Accesses'],"Late blight is a serious disease of potato worldwide. Our study aimed to unveil genes involved in late blight resistance in potato by RNA-seq analysis after artificial inoculation under controlled conditions. In this study, two potato somatic hybrids (P7 and Crd6) and three varieties such as Kufri Girdhari, Kufri Jyoti and Kufri Bahar (control) were used. Transcriptiome analysis revealed statistically significant (p < 0.05) differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were analysed into up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Further, DEGs were functionally characterized by the Gene Ontology annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Overall, some of the up-regulated genes in resistant genotypes were disease resistance proteins such as CC-NBS-LRR resistance protein, ankyrin repeat family protein, cytochrome P450, leucine-rich repeat family protein/protein kinase family, and MYB transcription factor. Sequence diversity analysis based on 38 peptide sequences representing 18 genes showed distinct variation and the presence of three motifs in 15 amino acid sequences. Selected genes were also validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Interestingly, gene expression markers were developed for late blight resistant genotypes. Our study elucidates genes involved in imparting late blight resistance in potato, which will be beneficial for its management strategies in the future."
Transcriptome analysis of cynomolgus macaques throughout their lifespan reveals age-related immune patterns,"['590 Accesses', '18 Altmetric']","Despite the different perspectives by diverse research sectors spanning several decades, aging research remains uncharted territory for human beings. Therefore, we investigated the transcriptomic characteristics of eight male healthy cynomolgus macaques, and the annual sampling was designed with two individuals in four age groups. As a laboratory animal, the macaques were meticulously shielded from all environmental factors except aging. The results showed recent findings of certain immune response and the age-associated network of primate immunity. Three important aging patterns were identified and each gene clusters represented a different immune response. The increased expression pattern was predominantly associated with innate immune cells, such as Neutrophils and NK cells, causing chronic inflammation with aging whereas the other two decreased patterns were associated with adaptive immunity, especially “B cell activation” affecting antibody diversity of aging. Furthermore, the hub gene network of the patterns reflected transcriptomic age and correlated with human illness status, aiding in future human disease prediction. Our macaque transcriptome profiling results offer systematic insights into the age-related immunological features of primates."
Direct RNA sequencing coupled with adaptive sampling enriches RNAs of interest in the transcriptome,"['8566 Accesses', '13 Altmetric']","Abundant cellular transcripts occupy most of the sequencing reads in the transcriptome, making it challenging to assay for low-abundant transcripts. Here, we utilize the adaptive sampling function of Oxford Nanopore sequencing to selectively deplete and enrich RNAs of interest without biochemical manipulation before sequencing. Adaptive sampling performed on a pool of in vitro transcribed RNAs resulted in a net increase of 22-30% in the proportion of transcripts of interest in the population. Enriching and depleting different proportions of the Candida albicans transcriptome also resulted in a 11-13.5% increase in the number of reads on target transcripts, with longer and more abundant transcripts being more efficiently depleted. Depleting all currently annotated Candida albicans transcripts did not result in an absolute enrichment of remaining transcripts, although we identified 26 previously unknown transcripts and isoforms, 17 of which are antisense to existing transcripts. Further improvements in the adaptive sampling of RNAs will allow the technology to be widely applied to study RNAs of interest in diverse transcriptomes."
A spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear,"['3171 Accesses', '1 Citations', '28 Altmetric']","A comprehensive understanding of inflorescence development is crucial for crop genetic improvement, as inflorescence meristems give rise to reproductive organs and determine grain yield. However, dissecting inflorescence development at the cellular level has been challenging owing to a lack of specific marker genes to distinguish among cell types, particularly in different types of meristems that are vital for organ formation. In this study, we used spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) to construct a precise spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear primordium, identifying 12 cell types, including 4 newly defined cell types found mainly in the inflorescence meristem. By extracting the meristem components for detailed clustering, we identified three subtypes of meristem and validated two MADS-box genes that were specifically expressed at the apex of determinate meristems and involved in stem cell determinacy. Furthermore, by integrating single-cell RNA transcriptomes, we identified a series of spatially specific networks and hub genes that may provide new insights into the formation of different tissues. In summary, this study provides a valuable resource for research on cereal inflorescence development, offering new clues for yield improvement."
Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals secretin as a hallmark of human enteroendocrine cell maturation,['358 Accesses'],"The traditional nomenclature of enteroendocrine cells (EECs), established in 1977, applied the “one cell - one hormone” dogma, which distinguishes subpopulations based on the secretion of a specific hormone. These hormone-specific subpopulations included S cells for secretin (SCT), K cells for glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), N cells producing neurotensin (NTS), I cells producing cholecystokinin (CCK), D cells producing somatostatin (SST), and others. In the past 15 years, reinvestigations into murine and human organoid-derived EECs, however, strongly questioned this dogma and established that certain EECs coexpress multiple hormones. Using the Gut Cell Atlas, the largest available single-cell transcriptome dataset of human intestinal cells, this study consolidates that the original dogma is outdated not only for murine and human organoid-derived EECs, but also for primary human EECs, showing that the expression of certain hormones is not restricted to their designated cell type. Moreover, specific analyses into SCT-expressing cells reject the presence of any cell population that exhibits significantly elevated secretin expression compared to other cell populations, previously referred to as S cells. Instead, this investigation indicates that secretin production is realized jointly by other enteroendocrine subpopulations, validating corresponding observations in murine EECs also for human EECs. Furthermore, our findings corroborate that SCT expression peaks in mature EECs, in contrast, progenitor EECs exhibit markedly lower expression levels, supporting the hypothesis that SCT expression is a hallmark of EEC maturation."
Incomplete transcripts dominate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis transcriptome,"['14k Accesses', '2 Citations', '79 Altmetric']","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease that is responsible for major health and economic costs worldwide1. Mtb encounters diverse environments during its life cycle and responds to these changes largely by reprogramming its transcriptional output2. However, the mechanisms of Mtb transcription and how they are regulated remain poorly understood. Here we use a sequencing method that simultaneously determines both termini of individual RNA molecules in bacterial cells3 to profile the Mtb transcriptome at high resolution. Unexpectedly, we find that most Mtb transcripts are incomplete, with their 5′ ends aligned at transcription start sites and 3′ ends located 200–500 nucleotides downstream. We show that these short RNAs are mainly associated with paused RNA polymerases (RNAPs) rather than being products of premature termination. We further show that the high propensity of Mtb RNAP to pause early in transcription relies on the binding of the σ-factor. Finally, we show that a translating ribosome promotes transcription elongation, revealing a potential role for transcription–translation coupling in controlling Mtb gene expression. In sum, our findings depict a mycobacterial transcriptome that prominently features incomplete transcripts resulting from RNAP pausing. We propose that the pausing phase constitutes an important transcriptional checkpoint in Mtb that allows the bacterium to adapt to environmental changes and could be exploited for TB therapeutics."
Time-course transcriptome data of silk glands in day 0–7 last-instar larvae of Bombyx mori (w1 pnd strain),"['384 Accesses', '5 Altmetric']","Time-course transcriptome expression data were constructed for four parts of the silk gland (anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the middle silk gland, along with the posterior silk gland) in the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori, from days 0 to 7 of the last-instar larvae. For sample preparation, silk glands were extracted from one female and one male larva every 24 hours accurately after the fourth ecdysis. The reliability of these transcriptome data was confirmed by comparing the transcripts per million (TPM) values of the silk gene and quantitative reverse transcription PCR results. Hierarchical cluster analysis results supported the reliability of transcriptome data. These data are likely to contribute to the progress in molecular biology and genetic research using B. mori, such as elucidating the mechanism underlying the massive production of silk proteins, conducting entomological research using a meta-analysis as a model for lepidopteran insect species, and exploring medical research using B. mori as a model for disease species by utilising transcriptome data."
The statistical geometry of transcriptome divergence in cell-type evolution and cancer,"['6079 Accesses', '36 Citations', '8 Altmetric']","In evolution, body plan complexity increases due to an increase in the number of individualized cell types. Yet, there is very little understanding of the mechanisms that produce this form of organismal complexity. One model for the origin of novel cell types is the sister cell-type model. According to this model, each cell type arises together with a sister cell type through specialization from an ancestral cell type. A key prediction of the sister cell-type model is that gene expression profiles of cell types exhibit tree structure. Here we present a statistical model for detecting tree structure in transcriptomic data and apply it to transcriptomes from ENCODE and FANTOM5. We show that transcriptomes of normal cells harbour substantial amounts of hierarchical structure. In contrast, cancer cell lines have less tree structure, suggesting that the emergence of cancer cells follows different principles from that of evolutionary cell-type origination."
"Single-cell transcriptome profiling highlights the importance of telocyte, kallikrein genes, and alternative splicing in mouse testes aging",['283 Accesses'],"Advancing healthcare for elderly men requires a deeper understanding of testicular aging processes. In this study, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of 43,323 testicular single cells from young and old mice, shedding light on 1032 telocytes—an underexplored testicular cell type in previous research. Our study unveiled 916 age-related differentially expressed genes (age-DEGs), with telocytes emerging as the cell type harboring the highest count of age-DEGs. Of particular interest, four genes (Klk1b21, Klk1b22, Klk1b24, Klk1b27) from the Kallikrein family, specifically expressed in Leydig cells, displayed down-regulation in aged testes. Moreover, cell-type-level splicing analyses unveiled 1838 age-related alternative splicing (AS) events. While we confirmed the presence of more age-DEGs in somatic cells compared to germ cells, unexpectedly, more age-related AS events were identified in germ cells. Further experimental validation highlighted 4930555F03Rik, a non-coding RNA gene exhibiting significant age-related AS changes. Our study represents the first age-related single-cell transcriptomic investigation of testicular telocytes and Kallikrein genes in Leydig cells, as well as the first delineation of cell-type-level AS dynamics during testicular aging in mice."
High-Throughput Transcriptome Profiling Of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reveals A Role For Wnt/GSK-3 Signaling In Their Hypoimmunomodulation,"['362 Accesses', '1 Citations']","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are gaining importance among clinicians following recent demonstration of safe allogeneic transplantation due to their ability to modulate the immune response. However,the molecular machinery regulating the expression of immunomodulatory factors in MSCs is unknown. We, therefore, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3),a Wnt signaling inhibitor, to elucidate the role of Wnt signaling in mediating immunoregulatory effects of human MSCs using gene expression profiling. Our results highlight enhanced ability of GSK-3 inhibitor (lithium) treated MSCs to evade immune response as a result of decreased expression of immune stimulatory cytokines and chemokines."
Tidings from the Tides–De novo transcriptome assembly of the endemic estuarine bivalve Villorita cyprinoides,['232 Accesses'],"The Indian black clam Villorita cyprinoides Gray, 1825, is an economically valuable estuarine bivalve that faces challenges from multiple stressors and anthropogenic pressures. However, limited genomic resources have hindered molecular investigations into the impact of these stressors on clam populations. Here, we have generated the first transcriptomic reference datasets for V. cyprinoides to address this knowledge gap. A total of 25,040,592 and 22,486,217 million Illumina paired-end reads generated from two individuals were assembled using Trinity and rnaSPAdes. From the 47,607 transcripts identified as Coding Domain Sequences, 37,487 returned positive BLAST hits against six different databases. Additionally, a total of 14,063 Single Sequence Repeats were identified using GMATA. This study significantly enhances the genetic understanding of V. cyprinoides, a potential candidate for aquaculture that supports the livelihoods of many people dependent on small-scale fisheries. The data generated provides insights into broader genealogical connections within the family Cyrenidae through comparative transcriptomics. Furthermore, this transcriptional profile serves as baseline data for future studies in toxicological and conservation genetics."
A distinct class of pan-cancer susceptibility genes revealed by an alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association study,"['4150 Accesses', '16 Altmetric']","Alternative polyadenylation plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression; however, current transcriptome-wide association studies mostly ignore alternative polyadenylation when identifying putative cancer susceptibility genes. Here, we perform a pan-cancer 3′ untranslated region alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association analysis by integrating 55 well-powered (n > 50,000) genome-wide association studies datasets across 22 major cancer types with alternative polyadenylation quantification from 23,955 RNA sequencing samples across 7,574 individuals. We find that genetic variants associated with alternative polyadenylation are co-localized with 28.57% of cancer loci and contribute a significant portion of cancer heritability. We further identify 642 significant cancer susceptibility genes predicted to modulate cancer risk via alternative polyadenylation, 62.46% of which have been overlooked by traditional expression- and splicing- studies. As proof of principle validation, we show that alternative alleles facilitate 3′ untranslated region lengthening of CRLS1 gene leading to increased protein abundance and promoted proliferation of breast cancer cells. Together, our study highlights the significant role of alternative polyadenylation in discovering new cancer susceptibility genes and provides a strong foundational framework for enhancing our understanding of the etiology underlying human cancers."
Natural proteome diversity links aneuploidy tolerance to protein turnover,"['18k Accesses', '2 Citations', '133 Altmetric']","Accessing the natural genetic diversity of species unveils hidden genetic traits, clarifies gene functions and allows the generalizability of laboratory findings to be assessed. One notable discovery made in natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is that aneuploidy—an imbalance in chromosome copy numbers—is frequent1,2 (around 20%), which seems to contradict the substantial fitness costs and transient nature of aneuploidy when it is engineered in the laboratory3,4,5. Here we generate a proteomic resource and merge it with genomic1 and transcriptomic6 data for 796 euploid and aneuploid natural isolates. We find that natural and lab-generated aneuploids differ specifically at the proteome. In lab-generated aneuploids, some proteins—especially subunits of protein complexes—show reduced expression, but the overall protein levels correspond to the aneuploid gene dosage. By contrast, in natural isolates, more than 70% of proteins encoded on aneuploid chromosomes are dosage compensated, and average protein levels are shifted towards the euploid state chromosome-wide. At the molecular level, we detect an induction of structural components of the proteasome, increased levels of ubiquitination, and reveal an interdependency of protein turnover rates and attenuation. Our study thus highlights the role of protein turnover in mediating aneuploidy tolerance, and shows the utility of exploiting the natural diversity of species to attain generalizable molecular insights into complex biological processes."
Transcriptome-wide association study of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder identifies associated genes and phenotypes,"['9580 Accesses', '48 Citations', '14 Altmetric']","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci associated with ADHD. However, understanding the biological relevance of these genetic loci has proven to be difficult. Here, we conduct an ADHD transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) consisting of 19,099 cases and 34,194 controls and identify 9 transcriptome-wide significant hits, of which 6 genes were not implicated in the original GWAS. We demonstrate that two of the previous GWAS hits can be largely explained by expression regulation. Probabilistic causal fine-mapping of TWAS signals prioritizes KAT2B with a posterior probability of 0.467 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and TMEM161B with a posterior probability of 0.838 in the amygdala. Furthermore, pathway enrichment identifies dopaminergic and norepinephrine pathways, which are highly relevant for ADHD. Overall, our findings highlight the power of TWAS to identify and prioritize putatively causal genes."
Systematic identification of abundant A-to-I editing sites in the human transcriptome,"['4643 Accesses', '648 Citations', '19 Altmetric']","RNA editing by members of the ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) family leads to site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in precursor messenger RNAs. Editing by ADARs is believed to occur in all metazoa, and is essential for mammalian development. Currently, only a limited number of human ADAR substrates are known, whereas indirect evidence suggests a substantial fraction of all pre-mRNAs being affected. Here we describe a computational search for ADAR editing sites in the human transcriptome, using millions of available expressed sequences. We mapped 12,723 A-to-I editing sites in 1,637 different genes, with an estimated accuracy of 95%, raising the number of known editing sites by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally validated our method by verifying the occurrence of editing in 26 novel substrates. A-to-I editing in humans primarily occurs in noncoding regions of the RNA, typically in Alu repeats. Analysis of the large set of editing sites indicates the role of editing in controlling dsRNA stability."
A transcriptome based molecular classification scheme for cholangiocarcinoma and subtype-derived prognostic biomarker,"['2775 Accesses', '1 Citations', '3 Altmetric']","Previous studies on the molecular classification of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) focused on certain anatomical sites, and disregarded tissue contamination biases in transcriptomic profiles. We aim to provide universal molecular classification scheme and prognostic biomarker of CCAs across anatomical locations. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis is performed on transcriptomic data from 438 CCA cases across various anatomical locations. After excluding CCA tumors showing normal tissue expression patterns, we identify two universal molecular subtypes across anatomical subtypes, explore the molecular, clinical, and microenvironmental features of each class. Subsequently, a 30-gene classifier and a biomarker (called “CORE-37”) are developed to predict the molecular subtype of CCA and prognosis, respectively. Two subtypes display distinct molecular characteristics and survival outcomes. Key findings are validated in external cohorts regardless of the stage and anatomical location. Our study provides a CCA classification scheme that complements the conventional anatomy-based classification and presents a promising prognostic biomarker for clinical application."
Impaired metal perception and regulation of associated human foliate papillae tongue transcriptome in long-COVID-19,"['1153 Accesses', '28 Altmetric']","Chemosensory impairment is an outstanding symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We hypothesized that measured sensory impairments are accompanied by transcriptomic changes in the foliate papillae area of the tongue. Hospital personnel with known SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) status completed questionnaires on sensory perception (n = 158). A subcohort of n = 141 participated in forced choice taste tests, and n = 43 participants consented to donate tongue swabs of the foliate papillae area for whole transcriptome analysis. The study included four groups of participants differing in IgG levels (≥ 10 AU/mL = IgG+; < 10 AU/mL = IgG-) and self-reported sensory impairment (SSI±). IgG+ subjects not detecting metallic taste had higher IgG+ levels than IgG+ participants detecting iron gluconate (p = 0.03). Smell perception was the most impaired biological process in the transcriptome data from IgG+/SSI+ participants subjected to gene ontology enrichment. IgG+/SSI+ subjects demonstrated lower expression levels of 166 olfactory receptors (OR) and 9 taste associated receptors (TAS) of which OR1A2, OR2J2, OR1A1, OR5K1 and OR1G1, as well as TAS2R7 are linked to metallic perception. The question raised by this study is whether odorant receptors on the tongue (i) might play a role in metal sensation, and (ii) are potential targets for virus-initiated sensory impairments, which needs to be investigated in future functional studies."
Transcriptome analysis reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancement of salt-tolerance in Melia azedarach under salinity stress,['780 Accesses'],"Melia azedarach demonstrates strong salt tolerance and thrives in harsh saline soil conditions, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed gene expression under low, medium, and high salinity conditions to gain a deeper understanding of adaptation mechanisms of M. azedarach under salt stress. The GO (gene ontology) analysis unveiled a prominent trend: as salt stress intensified, a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) became enriched in categories related to metabolic processes, catalytic activities, and membrane components. Through the analysis of the category GO:0009651 (response to salt stress), we identified four key candidate genes (CBL7, SAPK10, EDL3, and AKT1) that play a pivotal role in salt stress responses. Furthermore, the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were significantly enriched in the plant hormone signaling pathways and starch and sucrose metabolism under both medium and high salt exposure in comparison to low salt conditions. Notably, genes involved in JAZ and MYC2 in the jasmonic acid (JA) metabolic pathway were markedly upregulated in response to high salt stress. This study offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying M. azedarach salt tolerance and identifies potential candidate genes for enhancing salt tolerance in M. azedarach."
Transcriptome sequencing of seven deep marine invertebrates,"['725 Accesses', '25 Altmetric']","We present 4k video and whole transcriptome data for seven deep-sea invertebrate animals collected in the Eastern Pacific Ocean during a research expedition onboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor in August of 2021. The animals include one jellyfish (Atolla sp.), three siphonophores (Apolemia sp., Praya sp., and Halistemma sp.), one larvacean (Bathochordaeus mcnutti), one tunicate (Pyrosomatidae sp.), and one ctenophore (Lampocteis sp.). Four of the animals were sequenced with long-read RNA sequencing technology, such that the reads themselves define a reference assembly for those animals. The larvacean tissues were successfully preserved in situ and has paired long-read reference data and short read quantitative transcriptomic data for within-specimen analyses of gene expression. Additionally, for three animals we provide quantitative image data, and a 3D model for one siphonophore. The paired image and transcriptomic data can be used for species identification, species description, and reference genetic data for these deep-sea animals."
Prediction of m6A and m5C at single-molecule resolution reveals a transcriptome-wide co-occurrence of RNA modifications,"['6120 Accesses', '2 Citations', '38 Altmetric']","The epitranscriptome embodies many new and largely unexplored functions of RNA. A significant roadblock hindering progress in epitranscriptomics is the identification of more than one modification in individual transcript molecules. We address this with CHEUI (CH3 (methylation) Estimation Using Ionic current). CHEUI predicts N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in individual molecules from the same sample, the stoichiometry at transcript reference sites, and differential methylation between any two conditions. CHEUI processes observed and expected nanopore direct RNA sequencing signals to achieve high single-molecule, transcript-site, and stoichiometry accuracies in multiple tests using synthetic RNA standards and cell line data. CHEUI’s capability to identify two modification types in the same sample reveals a co-occurrence of m6A and m5C in individual mRNAs in cell line and tissue transcriptomes. CHEUI provides new avenues to discover and study the function of the epitranscriptome."
Transcriptome sequencing of garlic reveals key genes related to the heat stress response,['75 Accesses'],"With global warming, heat stress has become an important factor that seriously affects crop yield and quality. Therefore, understanding plant responses to heat stress is important for agricultural practice, but the molecular mechanism of high-temperature tolerance in garlic remains unclear. In this study, ‘Xusuan No. 6’ was used as the experimental material. After heat stress for 0 (CK), 2 and 24 h, transcriptome sequencing was used to screen metabolic pathways and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) closely related to heat stress and was further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 86,110 unigenes obtained from the raw transcriptome sequencing data were spliced. After 2 h of heat treatment, the expression levels of 8898 genes increased, and 3829 genes were decreased in leaves. After 24 h, the expression levels of 7167 genes were upregulated, and 3176 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in seven categories: cellular processes, metabolic processes, binging, catalytic activity, cellular anatomical entity and protein-containing complex response to stimulus. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment showed that DEGs are involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic antenna proteins. Six genes were selected and further verified by qRT-PCR. In this study, the full-length transcriptome of garlic was constructed, and the regulatory genes related to the heat resistance of garlic were studied. Taken together, these findings can provide a theoretical basis for the cloning of heat resistance genes in garlic and for the analysis of heat resistance mechanisms."
Effects of SPI1-mediated transcriptome remodeling on Alzheimer’s disease-related phenotypes in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis,"['3831 Accesses', '30 Altmetric']","SPI1 was recently reported as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in large-scale genome-wide association studies. However, it is unknown whether SPI1 should be downregulated or increased to have therapeutic benefits. To investigate the effect of modulating SPI1 levels on AD pathogenesis, we performed extensive biochemical, histological, and transcriptomic analyses using both Spi1-knockdown and Spi1-overexpression mouse models. Here, we show that the knockdown of Spi1 expression significantly exacerbates insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) levels, amyloid plaque deposition, and gliosis. Conversely, overexpression of Spi1 significantly ameliorates these phenotypes and dystrophic neurites. Further mechanistic studies using targeted and single-cell transcriptomics approaches demonstrate that altered Spi1 expression modulates several pathways, such as immune response pathways and complement system. Our data suggest that transcriptional reprogramming by targeting transcription factors, like Spi1, might hold promise as a therapeutic strategy. This approach could potentially expand the current landscape of druggable targets for AD."
An organism-wide atlas of hormonal signaling based on the mouse lemur single-cell transcriptome,"['2626 Accesses', '1 Altmetric']","Hormones mediate long-range cell communication and play vital roles in physiology, metabolism, and health. Traditionally, endocrinologists have focused on one hormone or organ system at a time. Yet, hormone signaling by its very nature connects cells of different organs and involves crosstalk of different hormones. Here, we leverage the organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), to systematically map source and target cells for 84 classes of hormones. This work uncovers previously-uncharacterized sites of hormone regulation, and shows that the hormonal signaling network is densely connected, decentralized, and rich in feedback loops. Evolutionary comparisons of hormonal genes and their expression patterns show that mouse lemur better models human hormonal signaling than mouse, at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels, and reveal primate-specific rewiring of hormone-producing/target cells. This work complements the scale and resolution of classical endocrine studies and sheds light on primate hormone regulation."
Advancing transcriptome platforms,['257 Accesses'],"During the last decade of years, remarkable technological innovations have emerged that allow the direct or indirect determination of the transcriptome at unprecedented scale and speed. Studies using these methods have already altered our view of the extent and complexity of transcript profiling, which has advanced from one-gene-at-a-time to a holistic view of the genome. Here, we outline the major technical advances in transcriptome characterization, including the most popular used hybridization-based platform, the well accepted tag-based sequencing platform, and the recently developed RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing) based platform. Importantly, these next-generation technologies revolutionize assessing the entire transcriptome via the recent RNA-Seq technology."
Whole genome and transcriptome integrated analyses guide clinical care of pediatric poor prognosis cancers,"['2511 Accesses', '5 Altmetric']","The role for routine whole genome and transcriptome analysis (WGTA) for poor prognosis pediatric cancers remains undetermined. Here, we characterize somatic mutations, structural rearrangements, copy number variants, gene expression, immuno-profiles and germline cancer predisposition variants in children and adolescents with relapsed, refractory or poor prognosis malignancies who underwent somatic WGTA and matched germline sequencing. Seventy-nine participants with a median age at enrollment of 8.8 y (range 6 months to 21.2 y) are included. Germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants are identified in 12% of participants, of which 60% were not known prior. Therapeutically actionable variants are identified by targeted gene report and whole genome in 32% and 62% of participants, respectively, and increase to 96% after integrating transcriptome analyses. Thirty-two molecularly informed therapies are pursued in 28 participants with 54% achieving a clinical benefit rate; objective response or stable disease ≥6 months. Integrated WGTA identifies therapeutically actionable variants in almost all tumors and are directly translatable to clinical care of children with poor prognosis cancers."
Transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal regulatory networks associated with nutrition synthesis in sorghum seeds,"['172 Accesses', '6 Altmetric']","Cereal seeds are vital for food, feed, and agricultural sustainability because they store and provide essential nutrients to human and animal food and feed systems. Unraveling molecular processes in seed development is crucial for enhancing cereal grain yield and quality. We analyze spatiotemporal transcriptome and metabolome profiles during sorghum seed development in the inbred line ‘BTx623’. Morphological and molecular analyses identify the key stages of seed maturation, specifying starch biosynthesis onset at 5 days post-anthesis (dpa) and protein at 10 dpa. Transcriptome profiling from 1 to 25 dpa reveal dynamic gene expression pathways, shifting from cellular growth and embryo development (1–5 dpa) to cell division, fatty acid biosynthesis (5–25 dpa), and seed storage compounds synthesis in the endosperm (5–25 dpa). Network analysis identifies 361 and 207 hub genes linked to starch and protein synthesis in the endosperm, respectively, which will help breeders enhance sorghum grain quality. The availability of this data in the sorghum reference genome line establishes a baseline for future studies as new pangenomes emerge, which will consider copy number and presence-absence variation in functional food traits."
Integrating human endogenous retroviruses into transcriptome-wide association studies highlights novel risk factors for major psychiatric conditions,"['16k Accesses', '1805 Altmetric']","Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are repetitive elements previously implicated in major psychiatric conditions, but their role in aetiology remains unclear. Here, we perform specialised transcriptome-wide association studies that consider HERV expression quantified to precise genomic locations, using RNA sequencing and genetic data from 792 post-mortem brain samples. In Europeans, we identify 1238 HERVs with expression regulated in cis, of which 26 represent expression signals associated with psychiatric disorders, with ten being conditionally independent from neighbouring expression signals. Of these, five are additionally significant in fine-mapping analyses and thus are considered high confidence risk HERVs. These include two HERV expression signatures specific to schizophrenia risk, one shared between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and one specific to major depressive disorder. No robust signatures are identified for autism spectrum conditions or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Europeans, or for any psychiatric trait in other ancestries, although this is likely a result of relatively limited statistical power. Ultimately, our study highlights extensive HERV expression and regulation in the adult cortex, including in association with psychiatric disorder risk, therefore providing a rationale for exploring neurological HERV expression in complex neuropsychiatric traits."
Transcriptome profiling of fast/glycolytic and slow/oxidative muscle fibers in aging and obesity,"['898 Accesses', '10 Altmetric']","Aging and obesity pose significant threats to public health and are major contributors to muscle atrophy. The trends in muscle fiber types under these conditions and the transcriptional differences between different muscle fiber types remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate distinct responses of fast/glycolytic fibers and slow/oxidative fibers to aging and obesity. We found that in muscles dominated by oxidative fibers, the proportion of oxidative fibers remains unchanged during aging and obesity. However, in muscles dominated by glycolytic fibers, despite the low content of oxidative fibers, a significant decrease in proportion of oxidative fibers was observed. Consistently, our study uncovered that during aging and obesity, fast/glycolytic fibers specifically increased the expression of genes associated with muscle atrophy and inflammation, including Dkk3, Ccl8, Cxcl10, Cxcl13, Fbxo32, Depp1, and Chac1, while slow/oxidative fibers exhibit elevated expression of antioxidant protein Nqo-1 and downregulation of Tfrc. Additionally, we noted substantial differences in the expression of calcium-related signaling pathways between fast/glycolytic fibers and slow/oxidative fibers in response to aging and obesity. Treatment with a calcium channel inhibitor thapsigargin significantly increased the abundance of oxidative fibers. Our study provides additional evidence to support the transcriptomic differences in muscle fiber types under pathophysiological conditions, thereby establishing a theoretical basis for modulating muscle fiber types in disease treatment."
"Genetic imputation of kidney transcriptome, proteome and multi-omics illuminates new blood pressure and hypertension targets","['5119 Accesses', '2 Citations', '64 Altmetric']","Genetic mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) regulation remain poorly defined. Using kidney-specific epigenomic annotations and 3D genome information we generated and validated gene expression prediction models for the purpose of transcriptome-wide association studies in 700 human kidneys. We identified 889 kidney genes associated with BP of which 399 were prioritised as contributors to BP regulation. Imputation of kidney proteome and microRNAome uncovered 97 renal proteins and 11 miRNAs associated with BP. Integration with plasma proteomics and metabolomics illuminated circulating levels of myo-inositol, 4-guanidinobutanoate and angiotensinogen as downstream effectors of several kidney BP genes (SLC5A11, AGMAT, AGT, respectively). We showed that genetically determined reduction in renal expression may mimic the effects of rare loss-of-function variants on kidney mRNA/protein and lead to an increase in BP (e.g., ENPEP). We demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.81) in expression of protein-coding genes between cells harvested from urine and the kidney highlighting a diagnostic potential of urinary cell transcriptomics. We uncovered adenylyl cyclase activators as a repurposing opportunity for hypertension and illustrated examples of BP-elevating effects of anticancer drugs (e.g. tubulin polymerisation inhibitors). Collectively, our studies provide new biological insights into genetic regulation of BP with potential to drive clinical translation in hypertension."
Using genome and transcriptome data from African-ancestry female participants to identify putative breast cancer susceptibility genes,"['1442 Accesses', '1 Altmetric']","African-ancestry (AA) participants are underrepresented in genetics research. Here, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) in AA female participants to identify putative breast cancer susceptibility genes. We built genetic models to predict levels of gene expression, exon junction, and 3′ UTR alternative polyadenylation using genomic and transcriptomic data generated in normal breast tissues from 150 AA participants and then used these models to perform association analyses using genomic data from 18,034 cases and 22,104 controls. At Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05, we identified six genes associated with breast cancer risk, including four genes not previously reported (CTD-3080P12.3, EN1, LINC01956 and NUP210L). Most of these genes showed a stronger association with risk of estrogen-receptor (ER) negative or triple-negative than ER-positive breast cancer. We also replicated the associations with 29 genes reported in previous TWAS at P < 0.05 (one-sided), providing further support for an association of these genes with breast cancer risk. Our study sheds new light on the genetic basis of breast cancer and highlights the value of conducting research in AA populations."
A single-cell transcriptome atlas of human euploid and aneuploid blastocysts,['2195 Accesses'],"Aneuploidy is frequently detected in early human embryos as a major cause of early pregnancy failure. However, how aneuploidy affects cellular function remains elusive. Here, we profiled the transcriptomes of 14,908 single cells from 203 human euploid and aneuploid blastocysts involving autosomal and sex chromosomes. Nearly all of the blastocysts contained four lineages. In aneuploid chromosomes, 19.5% ± 1.2% of the expressed genes showed a dosage effect, and 90 dosage-sensitive domains were identified. Aneuploidy leads to prevalent genome-wide transcriptome alterations. Common effects, including apoptosis, were identified, especially in monosomies, partially explaining the lower cell numbers in autosomal monosomies. We further identified lineage-specific effects causing unstable epiblast development in aneuploidies, which was accompanied by the downregulation of TGF-β and FGF signaling, which resulted in insufficient trophectoderm maturation. Our work provides crucial insights into the molecular basis of human aneuploid blastocysts and may shed light on the cellular interaction during blastocyst development."
MYC phase separation selectively modulates the transcriptome,"['2734 Accesses', '1 Citations', '24 Altmetric']","Dysregulation and enhanced expression of MYC transcription factors (TFs) including MYC and MYCN contribute to the majority of human cancers. For example, MYCN is amplified up to several hundredfold in high-risk neuroblastoma. The resulting overexpression of N-myc aberrantly activates genes that are not activated at low N-myc levels and drives cell proliferation. Whether increasing N-myc levels simply mediates binding to lower-affinity binding sites in the genome or fundamentally changes the activation process remains unclear. One such activation mechanism that could become important above threshold levels of N-myc is the formation of aberrant transcriptional condensates through phase separation. Phase separation has recently been linked to transcriptional regulation, but the extent to which it contributes to gene activation remains an open question. Here we characterized the phase behavior of N-myc and showed that it can form dynamic condensates that have transcriptional hallmarks. We tested the role of phase separation in N-myc-regulated transcription by using a chemogenetic tool that allowed us to compare non-phase-separated and phase-separated conditions at equivalent N-myc levels, both of which showed a strong impact on gene expression compared to no N-myc expression. Interestingly, we discovered that only a small percentage (<3%) of N-myc-regulated genes is further modulated by phase separation but that these events include the activation of key oncogenes and the repression of tumor suppressors. Indeed, phase separation increases cell proliferation, corroborating the biological effects of the transcriptional changes. However, our results also show that >97% of N-myc-regulated genes are not affected by N-myc phase separation, demonstrating that soluble complexes of TFs with the transcriptional machinery are sufficient to activate transcription."
Proteome allocation is linked to transcriptional regulation through a modularized transcriptome,"['2759 Accesses', '2 Altmetric']","It has proved challenging to quantitatively relate the proteome to the transcriptome on a per-gene basis. Recent advances in data analytics have enabled a biologically meaningful modularization of the bacterial transcriptome. We thus investigate whether matched datasets of transcriptomes and proteomes from bacteria under diverse conditions can be modularized in the same way to reveal novel relationships between their compositions. We find that; (1) the modules of the proteome and the transcriptome are comprised of a similar list of gene products, (2) the modules in the proteome often represent combinations of modules from the transcriptome, (3) known transcriptional and post-translational regulation is reflected in differences between two sets of modules, allowing for knowledge-mapping when interpreting module functions, and (4) through statistical modeling, absolute proteome allocation can be inferred from the transcriptome alone. Quantitative and knowledge-based relationships can thus be found at the genome-scale between the proteome and transcriptome in bacteria."
Full-length transcriptome sequencing of Arabidopsis plants provided new insights into the autophagic regulation of photosynthesis,"['419 Accesses', '2 Altmetric']","Autophagy is a highly conserved eukaryotic pathway and plays a crucial role in cell survival under stress conditions. Here, we applied a full-length transcriptome approach to study an Arabidopsis autophagy mutant (atg5-1) subjected to nitrogen-starvation, using Oxford Nanopore Technologies. A total of 39,033 transcripts were identified, including 11,356 new transcripts. In addition, alternative splicing (AS) events and lncRNAs were also detected between Col-0 (WT) and atg5-1. Differentially expressed transcript enrichment showed that autophagy upregulates the expression of many stress-responsive genes and inhibits the transcription of photosynthesis-associated genes. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression patterns of photosynthesis-related genes in the atg5-1 differed under the conditions of nitrogen starvation and carbon starvation. Under nitrogen starvation treatment, many genes related to photosynthesis also exhibited AS. Chlorophyll fluorescence images revealed that the Fv/Fm and ΦPSII of old atg5-1 leaves were significantly reduced after nitrogen starvation treatment, but the Y(NPQ) indices were significantly increased compared to those of the WT plants. The results of qRT-PCR suggest that autophagy appears to be involved in the degradation of genes related to photodamage repair in PSII. Taken together, the full-length transcriptiome sequencing provide new insights into how new transcripts, lncRNAs and alternative splicing (AS) are involved in plant autophagy through full-length transcriptome sequencing and suggest a new potential link between autophagy and photosynthesis."
Pan-transcriptome reveals a large accessory genome contribution to gene expression variation in yeast,"['7211 Accesses', '34 Altmetric']","Gene expression is an essential step in the translation of genotypes into phenotypes. However, little is known about the transcriptome architecture and the underlying genetic effects at the species level. Here we generated and analyzed the pan-transcriptome of ~1,000 yeast natural isolates across 4,977 core and 1,468 accessory genes. We found that the accessory genome is an underappreciated driver of transcriptome divergence. Global gene expression patterns combined with population structure showed that variation in heritable expression mainly lies within subpopulation-specific signatures, for which accessory genes are overrepresented. Genome-wide association analyses consistently highlighted that accessory genes are associated with proportionally more variants with larger effect sizes, illustrating the critical role of the accessory genome on the transcriptional landscape within and between populations."
"Natural Killer cells demonstrate distinct eQTL and transcriptome-wide disease associations, highlighting their role in autoimmunity","['14k Accesses', '4 Citations', '9 Altmetric']","Natural Killer cells are innate lymphocytes with central roles in immunosurveillance and are implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. The degree to which regulatory variants affect Natural Killer cell gene expression is poorly understood. Here we perform expression quantitative trait locus mapping of negatively selected Natural Killer cells from a population of healthy Europeans (n = 245). We find a significant subset of genes demonstrate expression quantitative trait loci specific to Natural Killer cells and these are highly informative of human disease, in particular autoimmunity. A Natural Killer cell transcriptome-wide association study across five common autoimmune diseases identifies further novel associations at 27 genes. In addition to these cis observations, we find novel master-regulatory regions impacting expression of trans gene networks at regions including 19q13.4, the Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor region, GNLY, MC1R and UVSSA. Our findings provide new insights into the unique biology of Natural Killer cells, demonstrating markedly different expression quantitative trait loci from other immune cells, with implications for disease mechanisms."
Entire expressed peripheral blood transcriptome in pediatric severe malarial anemia,"['944 Accesses', '1 Altmetric']","This study on severe malarial anemia (SMA: Hb < 6.0 g/dL), a leading global cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, compares the entire expressed whole blood host transcriptome between Kenyan children (3-48 mos.) with non-SMA (Hb ≥ 6.0 g/dL, n = 39) and SMA (n = 18). Differential expression analyses reveal 1403 up-regulated and 279 down-regulated transcripts in SMA, signifying impairments in host inflammasome activation, cell death, and innate immune and cellular stress responses. Immune cell profiling shows decreased memory responses, antigen presentation, and immediate pathogen clearance, suggesting an immature/improperly regulated immune response in SMA. Module repertoire analysis of blood-specific gene signatures identifies up-regulation of erythroid genes, enhanced neutrophil activation, and impaired inflammatory responses in SMA. Enrichment analyses converge on disruptions in cellular homeostasis and regulatory pathways for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, and heme metabolism. Pathway analyses highlight activation in response to hypoxic conditions [Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)−1 target and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) signaling] as a central theme in SMA. These signaling pathways are also top-ranking in protein abundance measures and a Ugandan SMA cohort with available transcriptomic data. Targeted RNA-Seq validation shows strong concordance with our entire expressed transcriptome data. These findings identify key molecular themes in SMA pathogenesis, offering potential targets for new malaria therapies."
